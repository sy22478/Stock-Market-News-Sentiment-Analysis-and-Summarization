# Stock Market News Sentiment Analysis and Summarization

## Project Overview
This project provides tools to analyze news related to the stock market, extract sentiment from headlines and articles, and generate summaries. It uses NLP techniques to process news data and helps users quickly understand market sentiment trends. The aim is to enable more informed trading or investment decisions based on news analysis.

## Features
- **News Ingestion:** Load and preprocess stock market news data.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Automatically detect positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using NLP models.
- **Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of key news content.
- **Data Visualization:** Display insights such as sentiment trends over time (if implemented in the notebook).
- **CSV Data Input:** Uses real news data in `stock_news.csv`.

## Requirements / Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Main Python libraries used (ensure these are listed in your notebook):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - nltk or spaCy (for NLP)
  - matplotlib / seaborn (if visualizations present)
  - Any additional dependencies from the notebook
